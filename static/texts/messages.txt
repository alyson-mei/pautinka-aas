2025-05-25 10:37:09+00:00: LMAO
2025-05-09 02:49:36+00:00: because she used to live on the streets as a kitten, and her previous owners were leaving her in another flat and only visited her once in two days she's not used to people and gets very spooked by strangers
warmed up to me only after two weeks
but it's better now
got comfy around markus after a day
though cats love him in general lmao
2025-05-09 02:33:29+00:00: we're becoming best friends! 🐈
2025-05-09 02:31:19+00:00: I love how now pautinka purrs loudly every time I pet her
also she's fully healthy, happy and active now!
😃

2025-04-20 07:26:42+00:00: her: has a whole bunch of toys
also her: plays with a plaster of all things
2025-04-19 17:05:08+00:00: what happens when I try to take pics of her standing up:
she always goes to rub at my hands when I'm close so this is how it always turns out
2025-04-19 11:10:26+00:00: she's so funny
2025-04-18 03:05:21+00:00: she's looking at the birds xd
2025-04-17 01:37:31+00:00: she runs to the window when she hears birds
it's so funny and cute
2025-04-17 01:36:14+00:00: she's purring
2025-04-11 19:01:48+00:00: I have tremor and my camera is shitty so pics are not of the best quality.
2025-04-11 02:15:00+00:00: 🤩

2025-03-23 03:15:20+00:00: poor baby
2025-03-22 22:18:10+00:00: pautinka is sick :(
we've already been to a vet, waiting for blood test results and the vet will say what's wrong
2025-03-13 21:02:15+00:00: her choices of sleeping places and positions keep getting weirder lmao

maybe she's testing if she's liquid 
(there's a small gap between the bed and the wall, and she's lying right on it)
2025-02-06 20:38:25+00:00: she looks so angry from this angle lmaooo
2025-01-29 21:40:04+00:00: piano is her new favourite place now xd
2025-01-20 12:23:01+00:00: cat donut

2025-01-12 11:17:55+00:00: she looks so funny from this angle
2024-12-31 21:02:00+00:00: pautinka meows "happy new year ❤️‍🩹"!
 
I tried to put a hat on her but she didn't want to wear it TT
this is the best I could do
2024-12-31 14:21:58+00:00: took pautinka to a vet for preventive examination and she's perfectly healthy!
she's a brave kitty 👣
2024-12-29 23:42:58+00:00: sleepy 💤
2024-12-06 23:45:48+00:00: new pose 🫠
2024-11-21 14:42:27+00:00: this meme fits pautinka when she's in a playful mood
something moving under the blancket? *__attack__*
2024-11-21 13:50:05+00:00: the laser pointer I have has a key ring attached to it, so it jingles whenever I move it
and it seems pautinka learned that jingling = laser play time cuz she runs to me excited whenever I grab the laser pointer
it's so cute
smart kittie 💻
2024-11-21 13:42:31+00:00: fluff ball 🥰
2024-11-13 03:45:45+00:00: sorry for the quality but look at this!! she's lying in her mini house
I was preparing to sell it cuz she never used it but ig she changed her mind
2024-11-03 07:08:06+00:00: she's looking at me whistling 
wonder what she's thinking
"__wow, has he finally gone crazy...?__"
2024-10-23 01:15:51+00:00: not only a master of makeup, but also a fierce warrior

while she was watching me play dnd she seemed to get into fighting mood cuz she randomly jumped on a table, threw off a cup, spilled its guts (coffee) all over the floor and ran away reveling in her victory 

if you're looking for a role model, look no further
2024-10-23 01:06:38+00:00: look at her white eyeliner
take notes, whoever here who does makeup
2024-10-23 01:04:04+00:00: kitty kiss 😚💋

2024-09-21 02:28:29+00:00: lmao when she comes for pets, all happy and purring, sometimes she gently bites my toes
